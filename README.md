# Project Status Update

The initial build of MazGPT is going well—core features are working, and the foundation is solid.

**Next Goal:**  
I want MazGPT to match (or even surpass) the capabilities of the latest AI models available today. This means:

- Natural, context-aware conversation flow
- Real-time web access and dynamic tool use (like searching, summarizing, image generation, etc.)
- Memory of previous chats and long-term context
- Support for multiple languages and code execution
- Advanced reasoning, summarization, and creative tasks
- Handling files, images, and structured data as context
- Easily extensible with new “skills” and plugins

**What I need from Copilot:**  
Suggest code, architectures, and features that help MazGPT achieve **feature parity** with modern LLMs, using only open-source components.  
Focus on modular, maintainable, and extensible design—so future upgrades are easy.

*Current focus:*  

- Plugin and tool integration (web search, Wikipedia, etc.)
- Improving chat memory & context retention
- Expanding conversational intelligence and response quality

If Copilot can suggest advanced techniques or improvements inspired by top models, that’s exactly what I’m looking for!
